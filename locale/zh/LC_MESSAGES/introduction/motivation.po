"The decentralization movement is ambitious and will provide awesome "
"opportunities for new social and economic interactions. Decentralization also "
"provides a counterbalance to abuses and corruption that occasionally occur in "
"large organizations where power is concentrated. Decentralization supports self-"
"determination and the rights of individuals to self-organize. Of course, the "
"realities of a more decentralized world will also have its challenges and "
"issues, such as how the needs of international law, public good, and compassion "
"will be honored."

"权力集中的大型组织偶尔发生的滥权和腐败。去中心化支持自我决策和权利分散的社区组"
"织。当然，分散的社区组织也将会面临挑战和问题，如国际法律、公共利益和慈善如何兑现"

"We admire the awesome innovations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other platforms "
"that have dramatically advanced the state of decentralized systems and ushered "
"in this new age of cryptocurrency and smart contracts. However, we also see "
"symptoms that those projects did not use the best engineering and formal models "
"for scaling and correctness in order to support mission-critical solutions. The "
"ongoing debates about scaling and reliability are symptomatic of foundational "
"architectural issues. For example, is it a scalable design to insist on an "
"explicit serialized processing order for all of a blockchain's transactions "
"conducted on planet earth?"

"我们非常赞赏比特币，以太坊和其他平台的巨大创新，这些平台大大推进了去中心化组织的"

"容问题和可靠性问题反应了这些平台底层架构的不足。例如，对于在地球上进行的所有区块"
"链交易，坚持一个明确的序列化处理顺序是否是一个可扩展的设计？"

"To become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility, RChain must "
"provide content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at "
"the speed of Visa. After due diligence on the current state of many blockchain "
"projects, after deep collaboration with other blockchain developers, and after "
"understanding their respective roadmaps, we concluded that the current and near-"
"term Blockchain architectures cannot meet these requirements. In mid-2016, we "

"Building quality software is challenging. It is easier to build \"clever\" "
"software; however, the resulting software is often of poor quality, riddled "
"with bugs, difficult to maintain, and difficult to evolve. Inheriting and "
"working on such software can be hellish for development teams, not to mention "
"their customers. When building an open-source system to support a mission-"
"critical economy, we reject a minimal-success mindset in favor of end-to-end "
